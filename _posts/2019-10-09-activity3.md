Explore the repository:
   - We forked the repository for this project into our own Git repository so we could use it for this activity: <https://github.com/research-reuse/PISA>
   	 - From our PISA repository, open and inspect:  
   	   - [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/research-reuse/PISA/tree/master/binder)
   	   - [`runtime.txt`](https://github.com/research-reuse/PISA/tree/master/binder) 
   	   
Open the Jupyter notebook file: [`pisa_project_part1.ipynb`](https://github.com/research-reuse/PISA/tree/master/pisa_basic/notebooks)
   - In the Git directory, find the location of the following `.csv` files (matching the filenames found in cell 2 of the Jupyter notebook):
     - `pisa_math_2003_2015.csv`
     - `pisa_read_2000_2015.csv`
     - `pisa_science_2006_2015.csv`
